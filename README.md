# Hydrogen
This GitHub repository is intended for development, but is open for users to get Nightly releases.

These "nightly" releases aren't really official, just get all the code with the green code button and unzip it. Rename the folder to Hydrogen instead of `Hydrogen-master` and you're good to go.

Report any bugs in the Discord. Thanks.
